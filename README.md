## Introduction

In a nutshell:
**hivefs** implements a fuse client for hive cluster.

**hivefs** is a fuse client that allows users to connect hive cluster servers using typical POSIX API.

for instance:
* You can use it to mount hive.cluster as a local disk driver or directory.
* You can read/write on the mounted like as on local file system.

### Background
- [FUSE](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/filesystems/fuse.txt)
(Filesystem In Userpace) is a Linux kernel filesystem that sends the
incoming requests over a file descriptor to userspace. Historically,
these have been served with a
[C library of the same name](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/), but
ultimately FUSE is just a protocol. Since then, the protocol has been
implemented for other platforms such as OS X, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

- hivefs is fuse app/client, it uses the library [bazil.org/fuse](http://bazil.org/fuse), which is a reimplementation of that
protocol in pure Go.

## Pre-Requirements

In order to run this app, FUSE installation is needed.

Ubuntu Linux:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fuse
```

macOS:  
Please download the installer package from:
[https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases)

## Compiling
hivefs is written in Go, so hereâ€™s how to get going:
```
git clone https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Hive.Demo.FuseApp.git  $GOPATH/src/$ github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Hive.Demo.FuseApp

cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Hive.Demo.FuseApp

make
```

## Usage

**hivefs** is a command line program that need to run in background. The usage is below:

```
./hivefs -host <host> -port <port number> -uid <uid> MOUNTPOINT
```
- host - hive cluster address. default is 127.0.0.1
- port - hive cluster port. default is 9095
- uid - uid string. the value is generated by "uid/new" http API. 
- MOUNTPOINT - mount target directory

for example:
```
$ ./hivefs -host 127.0.0.1 -port 9095 -uid uid-ee978fa7-18b6-43d4-9f3e-3e6562131036 /mnt
```
